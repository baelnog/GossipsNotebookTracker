# Gossips Notebook Tracker

[![.NET Core Desktop](https://github.com/baelnog/GossipsNotebookTracker/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/baelnog/GossipsNotebookTracker/actions/workflows/dotnet-desktop.yml)

A configurable tracker inspired by [Gossip Stone Tracker HD](https://github.com/HapaxL/GSTHD) and [HashFrog Tracker](https://github.com/wafo/hashfrog_tracker).

Gossips Notebook aims to offer the easier to define tracker layouts of HashFrog while maintaining the standalone nature of GSTHD which allows bringing your own long-lived resources.
